  'CI/CD_CREATE_DESC': `Pipeline is a collection of plugins that can be combined 
    to achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery. 
    Pipeline DSL provides us with an extensible set of tools that allow 
    us to implement simple to complex logic through code.`,
  username_password: 'Account Credentials',
  login_Plateform: 'Login platform',
  CREDENTIALS_DESC: `Credential is an object that contains some sensitive data, 
    such as username and password, SSH key and Token, etc., 
    used to provide authentication for the process of pulling code, 
    push/pull image, SSH script execution, etc. when Pipeline is running`,
  tips_Parametric_build: `The parameterized build process allows 
    you to pass in one or more parameters when you build. 
    For example: You may have a pipeline for publishing software and you 
    want to upload the release notes together. 
    This can be done by adding text parameters here. 
    Each parameter has a Name and a Value, 
    and the value of Value depends on the parameter type. 
    These values can be accessed in the Pipeline using params.Name or Name. 
    This means that each parameter defined here should have a unique name.
    When parameterizing a project, the build is replaced with a parameterized build, 
    which prompts the user to enter a value for each defined parameter. 
    If they choose not to enter anything, 
    the build proceeds with the default value for each parameter. 
    If the project's build is started automatically, for example, by a timed trigger, 
    it will be triggered with the default value of the parameter. `,
  tips_Authentication_token: `Enable this option if you need to 
    trigger a build by accessing a predefined URL. 
    A typical use of this feature is to trigger through the source code 
    management system's hook script. 
    You need to provide an authorization token in the form of a string so that 
    only the person with the authorization token can trigger the remote build.`,
  tips_disable_concurrent: `This will determine when the 
    project's build record should be discarded. 
    Build records include console output, archive artifacts, 
    and other metadata related to a particular build. 
    Keeping less builds saves disk space used by Jenkins. 
    We provide two options to determine when the old build should be discarded: 
    1. Number of days to keep the build: 
    If the build reaches a certain number of days, the build is discarded. 
    2. Keep the number of builds: 
    If there are already a certain number of builds, discard the oldest build. 
    The these two options can work on the build at the same time, 
    and if any of the limits are exceeded, any builds that exceed the limit will be discarded.`,
  tips_disable_concurrent_withscm: `This will determine when the branch should be discarded and all build records under the branch. 
    The build record includes the console output,
    Archive artifacts and other metadata related to a particular build. 
    Keeping less builds saves disk space used by Jenkins.
    We provide two options to determine when the old branch should be discarded: 
    1. Number of days to keep the branch: If the branch reaches a certain number of days, 
    the branch is dropped.
    2. Number of reserved branches: If a certain number of branches already exist, 
    the oldest branch is discarded. 
    These two options can work on the branch at the same time.

    any branches that exceed this limit will be dropped.`,
