  APPLICATIONS_DESC:
    'An application provides users with full business functionalities in one package. Application templates in KubeSphere are built on the Helm packaging specification. They are delivered through a unified public or private Helm repository. An application is composed of one or more Kubernetes objects such as workloads, services, ingress etc.',
  APP_DEPLOYMENT_DESC:
    'Lightweight, portable, self-contained software packaging technology that enables applications to run in the same way almost anywhere.',

  LB_ALG_DESC:
    'Support standard load balancing algorithms</br>ROUND_ROBIN：Polling, the default load balancing algorithm.</br>LEAST_CONN：Randomly select two healthy hosts, and then select one host with fewer links from the selected two hosts.</br>RANDOM：Pick one randomly from all healthy hosts.',
  LB_ROUND_ROBIN: 'ROUND_ROBIN',
  LB_LEAST_CONN: 'LEAST_CONN',
  LB_RANDOM: 'RANDOM',

  CLUSTER_NAME_DESC:
    'It can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens("-"), and must begin with a lowercase letter, ending with a number or lowercase letter. The maximum length of characters is set to 14.',

  CLUSTER_ALIAS_DESC:
    'Alias can be composed of any character to help you better distinguish resources and support Chinese names.',

  COMPONENT_VERSION_DESC:
    'For the application of governance to distinguish between components. It can only contain lowercase letters and numbers. The maximum length of characters is set to 16.',

  APP_WORKLOAD_TYPE_DESC:
    'Support stateless services (Deployment) and stateful services (StatefulSet)',

  BLUE_GREEN_DEPLOYMENT_DESC:
    'The blue-green release provides a zero downtime deployment which can deploy the new version while preserving the old version, and bring both versions running at the same time. If there is a problem with running, you can quickly roll back to the old version.',
  CANARY_RELEASES_DESC:
    'Introduce a part of the actual traffic into a new version for testing the performance and reliability of the new version, aiming to protect the overall system stability, early detection and adjustment of the problem.',
  TRAFFIC_MIRROR_DESC:
    'Traffic mirror is used to test the new version more realistically, to detect problems in advance without affecting the production environment, thus improving the security reliability of the release.',

  SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT: 'Stateless service(Deployment)',
  SERVICE_STATEFULSET: 'Stateful service(StatefulSet)',

  CONNECTION_POOL_TIP:
    'Create a fixed number of connection objects for the application, save them in the pool for reuse. The existing pool is available for each access, and is returned to the pool after use.',

  APP_GOVERNANCE_DESC:
    'If application governance enabled, the Istio-proxy container is injected as a SideCar in each component. <a href="https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>',

  POD_ISOLATION_RATIO_DESC:
    'Maximum % of Pod for the upstream service that can be ejected. It uses up rounding, when set to 13% it will isolate up to 2 instances if 10 instances exist.',
  BASE_EJECTION_TIME_DESC:
    'Minimum ejection duration. A host will remain ejected for a period equal to the product of minimum ejection duration and the number of times the host has been ejected.',
  CIRCUIT_DESC:
    'The circuit breaking is a microservice connection protection mechanism that addresses the avalanche effect. When a microservice of the fan-out connection is unavailable or the response time is too long, the service will be downgraded, and the call of the microservice of the node will be broken, and the error response is quickly returned. After detectin the microservice response is normal, the connection will be resumed. ',

    'KubeSphere supports application deployment (based on Helm) from app stores and app repositories, as well as home-made applications (Application CRD).',
  TIP_APP_GOVERNANCE:
    'Using App Governance requires creating a homebrew app and turning on service governance for each service',
  APP_REPOS_DESC:
    'The application repository comes from a third-party Helm Chart Repo, which visually exposes and provides deployment and management capabilities in KubeSphere, allowing users to quickly deploy applications one-click based on templates in the application repository.',
